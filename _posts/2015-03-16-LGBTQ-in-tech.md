title:  "LGBTQ in Tech"

Most people who know me know I'm gay, or that I identify as gay or queer
or whichever way you're more comfortable phrasing or thinking about it.
To put it bluntly: I like men, I date men, I sleep with men, I happen to
be a man and it's all good.

The thing that struck me about tech when I started getting more involved
in online communities is that no one cared about this fact. Well almost
no one, there's always going to be a hate monger or two, even online.
But I never got judged or excluded in tech because of my being gay. Even
when other members of the community were aware of it, I got judged on my
skills, on my contributions and insight, never based on which gender I
preferred to take to bed.

I have to be honest about something though, I never really "came out" in
tech as gay. I never really felt a need to state this. It came up every
now and then during conferences and other meetups but I was never "that
gay community member" and I never really wanted to be. I always told
myself that this was because if I would be totally honest and upfront
about it some people would judge me based on that fact alone, and I
didn't want that.

You go through enough pain and terror as a kid growing up, realising
you're different, coming out and what happens next. The fear that your
friends, your family, might not accept you for who you are. The
terrifying realisation that that bond you think you share might hinge on
you "fitting in". That thought that your job security relies on your
employer never finding out what you do in your off hours. I've been in
plenty bad spots in my life but I don't think I've ever been as
terrified as the first time I uttered the words "I need to tell you
something... I'm gay".

Part of this is why I never really made myself "known" as gay in the
tech community. Shame is a strong word, but I just didn't want to have
to deal, not again. That was a mistake. I've grown since then. I'm a
stronger person than that 17 year old kid ever was and if being "out and
proud" in tech will help promote a discussion around that topic and will
help others who might be trying to find their way in the tech community,
then I want to be part of that effort.

The tech community has a bad name at times. We're the evil tech
overlords, out to destroy the world, the bastards that want to get rich
on the back of everyone else. Those people that everyone else in San
Francisco regards with distrust, disgust, sometimes even hate. The root
of everything evil, capitalism and the social and wealth divide of our
current world. There's your fair amount of drama in different tech
communities too, even over things as simple as changing documentation to
use gender-neutral terms or codifying things like how we deal with each
other as humans in our codes of conduct. But we're growing and growing
up too.

My experience with the tech community has always been very positive but
I realise not everyone else's has. It shows in that there is the
[#DiversityInTech](https://twitter.com/hashtag/diversityintech)
hashtag, it shows in that we need to
[talk about this](https://web.archive.org/web/20190903192339/https://puppet.com/blog/womenintech-jessica-devita-of-microsoft),
it shows in that efforts like [TransTech](http://transtechsocial.org) exist.
But we do have those efforts, we do talk. It's not always pretty but we're
working on it, we're trying to get better at it. It's time I help out and I
hope you will too.

I don't know exactly how to go about this but I can start small,
identify myself as LGBTQ at those community events. I have a
[Rainbow Mickey pin](http://www.amazon.com/DISNEY-EXCLUSIVE-Mickey-Rainbow-Trading/dp/B0098QU6WY)
which I'll make sure to have on my jacket when I'm at tech
events just like I'll make a point in wearing an LGBTQ themed shirt. I
hope that this way and together with the organisers of each event we'll
be able to create a forum where we can discuss LGBTQ in tech and where
people feel like that they can be a techie and LGBTQ too. But even if
they don't feel comfortable just yet, know that they're not alone and
that there are people that they can reach out and talk to about this.
