Today I made one of the hardest decisions I’ve made in a while. I
decided to give up maintainership of two projects that I originally
started. The projects are pypuppetdb, a library to talk to the PuppetDB
API, and Puppetboard, a dashboard for PuppetDB that leverages
pypuppetdb.

Both projects started two years ago during my time at Nedap. The
existing open source dashboards for Puppet sort of sucked and none of
them were using PuppetDB so we were storing lots of duplicate data and
in an inefficient manner too.

Upon release both projects got some traction. Though the amount of
contributions have been limited a lot of people have reached out to tell
me they run Puppetboard and are very happy with it. This always made me
smile and was one of the main reasons I kept pushing forward with the
project.

I have commitments to many open source projects and with my recent move
I no longer really had a reason to continue development on both projects
from a professional need. From a personal perspective, I don't run Puppet
at home any more so I need to make that much more of an effort to find
reasons to work on them and get excited about them.

As such I've decided to ask the community to take over. I've been
spinning this idea in my mind since the beginning of 2015 but it scared
me. They're my projects and part of who am I, at least within the Puppet
community, is "the Puppetboard guy". Having worked on both projects for
so long and build them also gives you a strong feel of attachment and
responsibility. Did I really want someone else to decide the future
direction of both? On the other hand, do I really want to spend my
10%/hack days on maintaining two projects I don't really feel like
working on any more?

Being my first true open source projects I feel very attached to them,
sort of parental and protective of them. But truth be told I haven't
been treating both projects as good as I should have. In the end it's
about making the grown up decision and let go. As much as I feel like
I'm putting my child up for adoption, it deserves better than what I can
do for it now.

The question now becomes, who am I? In a way I'm still the Puppetboard
guy but not really. So if I don't work on this any more, then what? Do I
stop working on Puppet things? The answer there is no. I have a lot of
things that I'd still like to build and tie into the configuration
management space. This just gives me more space to try something new,
fresh ideas. Something to get excited about all over again.

What the next thing is going to be I don't know just yet, but if
anything it will be fun to do!
